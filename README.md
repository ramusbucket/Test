A lot of times the 2D games you play in the browser use canvas you can even do 3D stuff with web GL and some other libraries but this is basically an introduction to canvas and we're going to look at drawing shapes and paths as well as a little bit of animation and what gave me the idea for this is with the new uni course I'm working on which is a 20 vanilla JavaScript project course we built this little breakout game using canvas so you can see we can move the paddle and hit the ball and break the bricks and when it hits the bottom it resets so pretty simple but I realized when I was building this that I don't have any canvas videos on my channel so I wanted to do a crash course and then maybe later on down the line we can build some games alright so let's go ahead and jump into our VS code and I already have the HTML and CSS done because it's very very simple and I didn't want to waste time on it so we just have an H1 and then a canvas tag which is extremely important this is what allows us to use this API and have an idea of canvas with the width and the height of 600 and i'm just linking a stylesheet and a script JS so the stylesheet very very simple just a background color i'm using flexbox in the body to center everything and i made the canvas a light gray
